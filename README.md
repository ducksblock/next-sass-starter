## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ducksblock/next-sass-starter
# or
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ducksblock/next-sass-starter
```
Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:
```
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
## âœ¨ What's inside?
This Starter includes SASS or SCSS to get you started quickly on Next.js.

The rest of the Starter is based off of the Next.js default starter.
